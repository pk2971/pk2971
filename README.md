# Hi, I'm Praharshita Kaithepalli

I'm a data scientist passionate about uncovering insights from messy data, building intuitive dashboards, and solving real-world problems using clean, production-ready analytics. Iâ€™ve worked with nonprofits, museums, and fast-growing startups, delivering forecasting models, donor trend dashboards, and scalable ETL solutions.
