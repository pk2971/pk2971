## Work Experience
## Ticket Data Science/Analytics Intern @ BSE Global/Brooklyn Nets (_May 2023 - August 2023_)

Ticketing Analytics for NBA team Brooklyn Nets, WNBA team New York Liberty and the Barclays Center.
**Fan Retention Model**
- Analyzed  Brooklyn Netsâ€™s full season membership holders metrics to enable **segmentation** and targeted marketing efforts.
- Employed **PostgreSQL** to merge from various tables and preprocessed it to enable modeling.
- Developed a fan retention model in **Python**, leveraging Supervised classifiers **(Lasso)**.
- Optimized model performance through strategic **hyperparameter tuning**.

 **Revenue and Tickets Sold Dashboards (PostgreSQL, Tableau):**
- Developed PostgreSQL scripts for data extraction and integration in Tableau.
- Facilitated an accurate automated daily revenue and ticket sales visualization by sales representatives. 
- Partnered with the ticket operations team to create an interactive Tableau dashboard for real-time tracking and reporting of daily and weekly ticket sales, categorized by membership type.

**Other projects:**
- Extracted and integrated multi-year customer membership data using PostgreSQL and MS Excel.
- Assigned tenure scoring based on renewal frequency and calculated tenure-driven membership discounts which improved the renewal rate by 30%.
- Utilized Python (BeautifulSoup) to collect 10,000+ school/university contacts from various online sources, effectively generating group sales leads for a WNBA game.

## Projects
### Data-Driven EEG Band Discovery with Decision Trees

Developed objective strategy for discovering optimal EEG bands based on signal power spectra using **Python**. This data-driven approach led to better characterization of the underlying power spectrum by identifying bands that outperformed the more commonly used band boundaries by a factor of two. The proposed method provides a fully automated and flexible approach to capturing key signal components and possibly discovering new indices of brain activity.


### Decoding Physical and Cognitive Impacts of Particulate Matter Concentrations at Ultra-Fine Scales

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
