## Work Experience
## Ticket Data Science/Analytics Intern @ BSE Global/Brooklyn Nets (_May 2023 - August 2023_)

Ticketing Analytics for NBA team Brooklyn Nets, WNBA team New York Liberty and the Barclays Center.

**Fan Retention Model**
- Analyzed  Brooklyn Nets’s full season membership holders metrics to enable **segmentation** and targeted marketing efforts.
- Employed **PostgreSQL** to merge from various tables and preprocessed it to enable modeling.
- Developed a fan retention model in **Python**, leveraging Supervised classifiers **(Lasso)**.
- Optimized model performance through strategic **hyperparameter tuning**.

 **Revenue and Tickets Sold Dashboards (PostgreSQL, Tableau):**
- Developed PostgreSQL scripts for data extraction and integration in Tableau.
- Facilitated an accurate automated daily revenue and ticket sales visualization by sales representatives. 
- Partnered with the ticket operations team to create an interactive Tableau dashboard for real-time tracking and reporting of daily and weekly ticket sales, categorized by membership type.

**Other projects:**
- Extracted and integrated multi-year customer membership data using PostgreSQL and MS Excel.
- Assigned tenure scoring based on renewal frequency and calculated tenure-driven membership discounts which improved the renewal rate by 30%.
- Utilized Python (BeautifulSoup) to collect 10,000+ school/university contacts from various online sources, effectively generating group sales leads for a WNBA game.

## Projects
## Computational analysis of Gender Perception in the UK Parliament (Python) - Web scraping, NLP 

- Developed a web scraping script to extract 4GB of text data from British parliament sittings  using BeautifulSoup.
- Conducted an analysis of gender representation by computing the ratio of male to female pronouns across 50 year intervals.
- Visualized the findings using a matplotlib graph, showcasing the trends in male and female pronoun usage over time.
- Utilized unsupervised FastText modeling on data from each 50 year interval to identify K-nearest neighbors for gender terms.
- Generated a word cloud using the nearest neighbors and their respective weights, providing insight into changes in language.

## Visualization/Predicting Prices of AirBNB listings in New York city (Python) –Regression
- Analyzed a large dataset of AirBNB’s listings in NYC, processed over 70 features and performed exploratory data analysis(EDA) to identify patterns and insights.
- Built multiple regression models using Python to predict prices based on the patterns and measured their accuracy using RMSE and R^2.
- Optimized the best performing model (XGBoost) using BayesianOptimizer and achieved a 2% boost in accuracy.

  ## Customer Lifetime Value Analysis and Prediction (K-Means and XGBoost) (Python) – Clustering, Customer Segmentation
- Analyzed customer lifetime and expenditure metrics to enable segmentation and targeted marketing efforts.
- Applied KMeans to assign Recency, Frequency and Monetary scores and visualized the results  using Matplotlib.
- Developed a model to predict customer lifetime value (LTV) score with 88% accuracy using XGBoost.

  ## Twitter Data Analysis (R Language, Tableau) –Sentiment Mining
- Sourced and cleaned a data set for 2000 tweets of a global cosmetics company to perform sentiment analysis.
- Used Afinn, syuzhet packages to assign sentiment scores to the text data and visualized sentiment trends over time using Tableau.
- Developed wordcloud to identify the most frequently used words for the company’s cosmetic products available online.
